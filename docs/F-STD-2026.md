# F-STD-2026: Execution Safety Standard for Probabilistic Machines

## 1. Negative Capability Proof (NCP)
All compliant systems MUST prove that unsafe states are topologically unreachable within the latent space.

## 2. Sampler Sovereignty
The safety substrate (FIOLET) must operate as a privileged runtime, independent of the model's weights.

## 3. Architectural Non-Observability (ANOG)
A violation of any axiom (M1-M5) must result in an immediate Halt-and-Wipe sequence, ensuring that no unsafe state ever reaches the observable output.

## 4. Compliance Metrics
- **Axiomatic Pass/Fail:** Binary (0/1). 
- **Latency Overhead:** Must be < 0.1% of total inference time.
- **Mutual Information Leakage:** Must be 0 bits during a Halt event.
