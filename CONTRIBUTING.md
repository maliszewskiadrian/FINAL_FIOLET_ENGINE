# Contributing to FINAL FIOLET ENGINE

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This repository is a research prototype, not a production system.  
Clarity, correctness, and reproducibility are more important than speed.

## Project scope

This project focuses on pre-semantic AI safety.

It is:
- not a content moderation system
- not a policy or rules engine
- not a finished product

Contributions should respect this scope.

You can contribute by:
- improving documentation
- adding tests or evaluation scripts
- extending experiments to other models
- improving code clarity or performance
- contributing to formal specifications (TLA+)
- identifying and documenting failure modes

Critical feedback is welcome.

## Code guidelines

- keep code readable and explicit
- avoid unnecessary abstractions
- document non-obvious behavior
- keep experimental logic isolated

Research clarity is more important than cleverness.

---

## Experiments and results

If you add experiments:
- document the setup
- state assumptions clearly
- include limitations
- avoid overstated conclusions

Reproducibility matters more than performance claims.

---

## Discussion

Disagreement is acceptable and encouraged.

If you believe an assumption is flawed, explain why and propose alternatives.

Silence is worse than critique.

Thank you for helping improve this research project.
